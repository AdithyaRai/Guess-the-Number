# Guess-the-Number
The "Guess the Number" project in Python is a simple game where the computer randomly selects a number using the random library, and the user tries to guess it. The program takes the userâ€™s input, compares it with the generated number, and gives feedback on whether the guess is correct or not. The game continues until the user guesses the right number, making it a fun way to practice loops, conditionals, and user input in Python.
